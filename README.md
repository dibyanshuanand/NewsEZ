## NewsEZ

NewsEZ is a simple news headlines fetching app, which uses [News API](https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started) to fetch and display [top headlines](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines) for India.
The user can also mark articles as Bookmarks, which are stored locally on the device and can be viewed later.
Some highlights about the project are:

- Built using MVVM architecture
- Reactive in flow, using LiveData
- Uses Retrofit for network calls
- Implements pagination with 20 results per page
- Handles network availability with UI feedback
- Uses Room for on-device data persistence
- Uses Glide for image loading, with data failure handling
